# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
For this analysis of school districts, we were tasked to create dataframes that contain each student's grades in math and reading along with the budget of the school and type of school.

## Results
- The district summary showed lower passing percentages overall when we removed the reading scores of 9th graders from Thomas High School.
- The school summary of Thomas High was affected by the same change and showed lower reading scores across the grades at Thomas.
- These findings compared to other schools showed Thomas High's overall performance to be lower than other schools due to the lack of data for their test scores.
- Replacing 9th grade scores:
- Doing this caused the average 9th graders score to decrease slightly with Thomas High School's 9th graders score data not factored in.
- The school budget had no change since the students scores were removed, and not the students themselves.
- The size of the school also remained the same due to just the reading and math scores being removed from the dataset.
- The type of school was not affected by the removal of student scores.

## Summary
Overall, removing the 9th grader's test scores showed that the districts had a slightly lower passing percentage as well as just for Thomas High School. The total 9th grade population saw a decrease in their passing percentages.
